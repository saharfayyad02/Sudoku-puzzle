# Sudoku Game

This Python project implements a Sudoku game where players can solve Sudoku puzzles interactively. It offers both single-player and two-player modes, allowing users to choose between filling in Sudoku puzzles themselves or competing against each other.

## Features

- **Single Player Mode**: In this mode, the player can choose to solve Sudoku puzzles, receive hints, or let the system fill in cells.
- **Two Player Mode**: Players take turns filling in cells of a Sudoku puzzle. They can choose to solve the puzzle, pass the turn, or receive hints.
- **Random Puzzle Generation**: In single-player mode, the system can generate random Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels (easy, medium, difficult).
